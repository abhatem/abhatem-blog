Hello World! I'm Abdullah Al-Hatem, a software developer living in Munich, and overall chill guy :)

I'm a Technical University of Munich M.Sc. Robotics, Cognition, Intelligence grad. By day, I work on embedded systems. By night, I tinker with software and hardware projects, and sometimes I even write about them. 

**Why this blog?**
- Keep track of projects and experimentsâ€”failures included.
- Share notes and resources that help me (and might help you).
- Put complex ideas into plain words so future me can remember what present me was thinking.
